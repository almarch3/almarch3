## All About ME! ðŸ‘‹
### Andrea Marchant - Wife/Mother of 4
*Some important things about me:*
- I'm a senior credit wise, but a freshman degree wise.
- I live in Indiana.
- Going back to school was to help my family financially.
- Computers are something I understand more easily than other things.
- We currently have backyard chickens that we keep for eggs.
- Someday, I hope to create an animated TV show with my husband and kids about stories they makeup and act out.
